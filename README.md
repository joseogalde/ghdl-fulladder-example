# ghdl-fulladder-example
Simple testing files for GHDL files (Open Source tools for VDHL)

It is based on a simple 2-bit FUll Adder VHDL code to be implemented with GHDL and tested with GtkWave by looking its waveforms.
It also include a second directory of a "HelloWorld" printing example.

Both examples are intented to be very basic, just for the purpose of testing that our VHDL environment works fine after installation.
